                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Our deepfake detection system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze images and detect whether they have been manipulated. The system is built using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, which is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.</p>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Upload or Capture Image:</strong> Users can either upload an image from their device or capture an image using their webcam.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> The uploaded or captured image is sent to our server, where it is processed by our deepfake detection model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Inference:</strong> The YOLO model analyzes the image and determines whether it contains any signs of manipulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result Display:</strong> The result of the analysis is displayed to the user, indicating whether the image is likely to be a deepfake.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>Our system leverages the following technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flask:</strong> A lightweight web framework for building the server-side application.</li>
                    <li><strong>YOLO:</strong> A real-time object detection system that is used to detect manipulations in images.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</strong> Front-end technologies used to build the user interface.</li>
                </ul>
